## Submission Categories

&ldquo;Submission Categories&rdquo; refers to the topics, chronologies, and geographies self-selected by submitting authors. Topics, in particular, remain a contentious ... topic, as we try to balance the need to keep options manageable with the need to ensure authors' work is fairly categorized and easy to find by attendees.

This year, the categories were modeled on those found in the *Isis* Cumulative Bibliography.
