### Comments on Meeting Satisfaction

#### The Good üëèüëèüëè

<div class="choice-quotes">
<pullQuote title="The program was fantastic, and Utrecht was a wonderful venue. I really liked not being in a conference hotel."/>
<pullQuote title="how all participants banded together to beat the heat - very collegial, and an overall absence of heat-related short tempers; I attribute this to the excellent organization of the conference"/>
<pullQuote title="Just a great academic and social experience, with excellent research, good social opportunities (those evening receptions with plenaries really help), and a pleasant academic environment (despite the heat)"/>
<pullQuote title="The setting. Utrecht was beautiful. The university buildings were old and charming, and refreshing compared to the often corporate feel of the hotels the conference usually takes place in. I also thought it was really well-organised and the heatwave was dealt with well under the circumstances. ... There were other really nice touches, like the flavoured water being offered. I really enjoyed myself."/>
<pullQuote title="The feeling of camaraderie among colleagues, the space where the sessions were held, the awards ceremony, the Lectures. The city. The attention of the yellow shirts. My own participation."/>
<pullQuote title="The sessions and program throughout the days - the local administration in Utrecht was also fantastically nice and helpful."/>
<pullQuote title="So many things! The relaxed atmosphere (maybe the heat had something to do with it?), learning more about European and other international work, the university setting, the great care taken by all to ensure that we would not have heatstroke!"/>
<pullQuote title="It was my first time at HSS and I enjoyed exchanging ideas with a different crowd! No one on my panel knew one another beforehand, and I think we will stay in touch."/>
<pullQuote title="The organization of the conference -- online and off -- was fantastic. I really appreciated the work to connect everybody, and the huge effort for accessibility. This made everything collegial and wonderful!"/>
<pullQuote title="Panels were great, organisation fantastic; most of all: NOT a conference hotel but embedded in a beautiful city which allowed for pleasant experiences beyond the conference. I would urgently plead to keep this model and refrain from the big box conference hotels where everybody is stuck (and which are so expensive!)"/>

#### The Bad üòß

<div class="choice-quotes">
<pullQuote title="Academic quality low overall, but there were many exceptions"/>
<pullQuote title="Mostly the inhumane heat without AC! Also, the poor administrative arrangement is another drawback"/>
<pullQuote title="Clearly the organizers could do nothing regarding the extreme weather but contingency plans could have been made. A non air conditioned venue is a problem (for comfort and concentration etc.) even at 85/90, which is not unheard of in Utrecht in July. In 100 it's dangerous. Future conferences must make every effort possible to include everybody, including those with health challenges. Where AC was unavailable, panels held in the afternoon probably should have been cancelled."/>
