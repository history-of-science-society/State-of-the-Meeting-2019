### Comments on Meeting Satisfaction

#### The Good üëèüëèüëè <Badge text="a select few" />

<div class="choice-quotes">
<pullQuote title="The program was fantastic, and Utrecht was a wonderful venue. I really liked not being in a conference hotel."/>
<pullQuote title="how all participants banded together to beat the heat - very collegial, and an overall absence of heat-related short tempers; I attribute this to the excellent organization of the conference"/>
<pullQuote title="Just a great academic and social experience, with excellent research, good social opportunities (those evening receptions with plenaries really help), and a pleasant academic environment (despite the heat)"/>
<pullQuote title="The setting. Utrecht was beautiful. The university buildings were old and charming, and refreshing compared to the often corporate feel of the hotels the conference usually takes place in. I also thought it was really well-organised and the heatwave was dealt with well under the circumstances. ... There were other really nice touches, like the flavoured water being offered. I really enjoyed myself."/>
<pullQuote title="The feeling of camaraderie among colleagues, the space where the sessions were held, the awards ceremony, the Lectures. The city. The attention of the yellow shirts. My own participation."/>
<pullQuote title="The sessions and program throughout the days - the local administration in Utrecht was also fantastically nice and helpful."/>
<pullQuote title="So many things! The relaxed atmosphere (maybe the heat had something to do with it?), learning more about European and other international work, the university setting, the great care taken by all to ensure that we would not have heatstroke!"/>
<pullQuote title="It was my first time at HSS and I enjoyed exchanging ideas with a different crowd! No one on my panel knew one another beforehand, and I think we will stay in touch."/>
<pullQuote title="The organization of the conference -- online and off -- was fantastic. I really appreciated the work to connect everybody, and the huge effort for accessibility. This made everything collegial and wonderful!"/>
<pullQuote title="Panels were great, organisation fantastic; most of all: NOT a conference hotel but embedded in a beautiful city which allowed for pleasant experiences beyond the conference. I would urgently plead to keep this model and refrain from the big box conference hotels where everybody is stuck (and which are so expensive!)"/>
<pullQuote title="University setting, phenomenal responsiveness of local organizers and
HSS staff in responding to unexpected heat wave, portable/throwable mics
in the rooms, being able to take notes on a desk rather than my lap,
excellent sessions, friendly people... honestly the whole meeting was a
delight personally and intellectually. Thank you!" />
<pullQuote title="This was my first HSS meeting, and, to be perfectly honest, it was perhaps
the best-organized conference I have ever had the pleasure to attend. My
only hope is that you continue this model -- and that it can be extended to
other conferences. I am really excited to attend my next HSS conference
based on my experience here, and I will be certain to recommend this
conference to my colleagues. Thank you for an exciting, invigorating, and
beautifully-collegial conference!" />
<pullQuote title="It was fabulously organised. I think the best conference I have ever
been to. The volunteers were happy, helpful and always impeccably
organised. The app was very clear and easy to use." />
</div>


#### The Bad üòß <Badge text="all of it" />

<div class="choice-quotes">
<pullQuote title="Academic quality low overall, but there were many exceptions"/>
<pullQuote title="Mostly the inhumane heat without AC! Also, the poor administrative arrangement is another drawback"/>
<pullQuote title="Clearly the organizers could do nothing regarding the extreme weather but contingency plans could have been made. A non air conditioned venue is a problem (for comfort and concentration etc.) even at 85/90, which is not unheard of in Utrecht in July. In 100 it's dangerous. Future conferences must make every effort possible to include everybody, including those with health challenges. Where AC was unavailable, panels held in the afternoon probably should have been cancelled."/>

## From the Suggestion Box <Badge text="a select few" />

<div class="choice-quotes">
<pullQuote title="HSS has a major diversity problem: both ethnic and nationalistic. The
meeting is overwhelmingly attended by Europeans and North Americans.
This is partly because of the lack of financial support afforded to scholars
based in low income countries and partly due to the arduous and
extortionate process of applying for visas. I would strongly recommend
providing financial support for visa costs and subsidising travel from
low-middle income countries irrespective of career status." />
<pullQuote title="It is better to cancel events than 'plough ahead' in dangerous conditions.
HSS must ensure the safety of all attendees. Perhaps events in late
afternoon should have been held remotely. HSS must now clarify its policy
on the health and safety of conference attendees.
Sadly, there will always be those who advertise their commitment through
stoic calls to 'keep calm etc. etc.' -- that won't do. This isn't Iron Man. Such
attitudes, if implicitly accepted as the policy of HSS, become a form of
discrimination against those unable to attend in extreme conditions.
It's now time for an official statement from HSS on precisely what its health
and safety policy is." />
<pullQuote title="The Flashtalks session actually worked really well, despite my initial
skepticism. Perhaps there could be more than one to bring even more
junior scholars into the conference." />
<pullQuote title="Sessions with overlapping topics seem to often be scheduled against
each other. I know scheduling must be difficult, and some conflicts are
inevitable, but it seems like there must be a better way!" />
<pullQuote title="Perhaps have it at 2 or 3 locations at once, on different continents, so that
less people have to fly. I think with technology, it can still feel like one
conference. E.g. if a keynote is in North America, than people in Europe
and Asia (for example) can listen via Skype, but still in a big hall together. I
have positive experiences with this at another conference.
The call for papers could have been a bit earlier, especially since the
deadline was shortly after the holidays. For me, trying to organize a panel
and not having a big network yet as a PhD-student, it was a bit stressful,
(though not impossible as we did manage to get together the panel just in
time)." />
<pullQuote title="A plan of the meeting rooms in the PdF/programme would have saved
some confusions and late arrivals.
A longer CFP window to enable session-wrangling (I regretted not
arranging a session, as my session was very miscellaneous)." />
<pullQuote title="Diversity continues to be a key challenge for HSS. It would be a huge
benefit to think of ways of engaging more graduate students and emerging
scholars from non-European backgrounds into the meeting. Special
outreach, travel funding, and/or a dedicated prize may be ways of
approaching this." />
<pullQuote title="Offer /do even more to encourage non traditional formats and sessions on
newer topics/questions that can be approached in a variety of ways
particular to historians of science e.g. climate change, decolonization,
migrant crisis, reckoning with gender dynamics etc" />
<pullQuote title="Keep doing name badges without institutional affiliation -- it was a great
way to cut down on the social weirdness regarding rank/affiliation, it gave
everyone a nice conversation opener about where they're currently based,
and made it easier for independent and early career researchers to work
out how to list their affiliations. Great move, keep doing it." />
<pullQuote title="Diversity within the discipline still seems to be a fundamental issue. It
remains extremely noticeable that so few BME researchers are involved. It
was good to see a discussion group on LGBTQ+ issues in HSTM, but this
was not a full panel and happened at lunchtime, giving a prevailing feeling
that queer dimensions of the field are still considered peripheral or
unimportant. It would be good to see HSS tackle some of these issues
more boldly at the nest meeting." />
<pullQuote title="[...] It's all
very well saying we want to engage more with history of science
scholarship from the global south, but if we don't then go to those talks and
actually do the engaging, it's really not great. There's not one easy solution
to this, but I wanted to raise it explicitly." />
<pullQuote title="There is a real inequity between organised sessions and those put together
by the organisers from submitted papers. With a few exceptions, the latter
were poorly attended. It is very demoralising to give a paper to four people.
It is also a waste of scholarly resources, and creates a two-tier system.
Please could HSS think about how to value non-organised sessions. For
example, we talked in the chemistry group about publicising chemistry
papers even in non-organised sessions; it might also be worth HSS
nominating rapporteurs to go to non-organised sessions so that the Society
is making sure that people's work is heard by senior colleagues." />
<pullQuote title="The registration pack in its current form is hardly worth the trouble--it would
be helpful for everyone to be given a printed map showing all the room
locations, and another map showing any 'external' sites. Also offer small
academic societies/interest groups a chance to include brochures/materials
at minimal or no cost." />
<pullQuote title="- provide a simple (paid) lunch, to facilitate meeting colleagues in an
informal setting
- provide a bit more time for breaks, for the same reason
- don't hold the (wonderful) graduate student book giveaway only 5 minutes
after the official end of the last session, when several sessions were still
ongoing
- the meeting app is extremely useful, but still has a few programming
flukes that make it more cumbersome to use than necessary" />
<pullQuote title="I found the website with the program schedule rather frustrating
this year-while it was great for searching for particular sessions, I had a
really difficult time trying to get any kind of overview of the conference
(again, maybe this was actually possible & I just couldn't figure out how, or
maybe it actually was indeed difficult...). So, making this aspect of the
conference more user-friendly, as it's been in the past, would be very
helpful." />
<pullQuote title="-Limit sessions to 1.5 hours (2 hours was too long)
-Provide more than a 30-minute gap between the end of the last session
and start of the evening events
-Accept more pedagogical session proposals
-Encourage senior members to be friendlier to junior attendees (HSS still
has a bad reputation in this regard)" />
<pullQuote title="The Website, the electronic submission process, and the APP were all too
complex and I did not find these user-friendly. Use another system next
time. It was too difficult to find out information on ones own session, and
get updates." />
