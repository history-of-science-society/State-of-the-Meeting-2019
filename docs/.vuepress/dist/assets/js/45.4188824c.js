Flashtalks and Caucus meetings enhanced the simultaneous sessions (twelve this year). The program was truly global in scope, with sessions on the sciences and medicine in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and the Pacific. There was an interest in the future, not just through real engagements, but also in scientific speculations and science fiction. There was much concern with material culture and practice, or, as Norton Wise put it during his speech accepting the Sarton medal, the history of science has come to be defined by a focus on materiality. Early modern science was well represented in the Utrecht meeting, reflecting a large number of submissions in this area.

Taking advantage of a new technology, the portable tape recorder, Kuhn imagined capturing the intellectual and social minutiae of the process of discovery.
