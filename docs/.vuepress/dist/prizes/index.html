Her dissertation, “Technologies of Perception: The Search for Life and Intelligence Beyond Earth” uses both historical and ethnographic methods to analyze how radio and optical astronomers call upon familiar modes of sensing to make meaning about as-yet-undiscovered objects: the alien and extraterrestrial life. “Technologies of Perception” asks: How did scientists construct experimental systems to imagine, relate to, and investigate unknown objects—ET and exotic microbes—through Earthly models of life and intelligence? Using historical material dating from 1950s-2000s, she contends that scientists imagined potential Others—extraterrestrial microbes and beings—through Earth- and body-bound metaphors of seeing (exobiologists) and listening (SETI scientists). Scientists created technologies of perception using optical and radio techniques by which they bridged the space between definitions of Earthly life and human intelligence and as-yet-unknown, but potentially commensurable, forms of Other life and Other intelligence. At stake were new formulations of perceptibility and sensibility; clues to the origin of (intelligent) life on Earth; and, a transformed connection to the cosmos through technology in the post-War II era.</p> <p class="committee">Omar Nasim, HSS Representative for the Fellowship Committee</p> <div class="divider"></div> <h2 id="reingold-prize"><a href="#reingold-prize" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Reingold Prize</h2> <div class="tip custom-block"><p>Established in 1955 by Ida and Henry Schuman of New York City to recognize an original graduate student essay on the history of science and its cultural influences. <a href="https://hssonline.org/about/honors/nathan-reingold-prize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p></div> <p class="prize-winner">Brad Bolman</p> <p class="prize-winner-affiliation">Harvard University</p> <img alt="Brad Bolman, Reingold Prize Winner" src="/assets/img/Bolman - Headshot - 2019.7e12fad1.jpg" class="prize-winner-headshot"> <p>In “Pig Mentations: Race and Face in Radiobiology and Beyond,” Brad Bolman traces the emergence of the pig as an experimental animal in post-war North America, and particularly the white pig as a product and producer of that era’s ideas of race. In radiobiological studies of the effects of flash burns after nuclear detonations the “white pig” was putatively chosen because pig skin was deemed closest to human skin, and because whiteness revealed burn effects most clearly. Yet the white pig embodied cultural assumptions, prejudices and privileges as white pigs were identified with the skin of some universal “Man,” assumed to be self-evidently white. In lively and insightful prose, Bolman tracks these developments in the process of creating test pigs at the Experimental Animal Farm in Hanford, Washington, in the 1950s and 60s. The essay is a fascinating exploration of “species projection,” rehearsing human difference in research organisms, made visible by bringing together analyses from race studies, the history of science, and animal studies.</p> <p class="committee">Simon Werrett (Chair), Dániel Margócsy, Alisha Rankin</p> <img alt="Bolman accepts Reingold Prize with Lightman" src="/assets/img/bolman.918fb4ce.jpg" class="fullbleed"> <div class="divider"></div> <h2 id="pauly-prize"><a href="#pauly-prize" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Pauly Prize</h2> <div class="tip custom-block"><p>Awarded for the best first book on the history of science in the Americas and written in English. <a href="https://hssonline.org/about/honors/philip-j-pauly-prize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p></div> <p class="prize-winner">Megan Raby</p> <p class="prize-winner-affiliation">The University of Texas at Austin</p> <img alt="Megan Raby, Pauly Prize Winner" src="/assets/img/Raby - Headshot - 2019.6c1c3691.jpg" class="prize-winner-headshot"> <p>Megan Raby’s book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/American-Tropics-Caribbean-Biodiversity-Migrations/dp/1469635607?SubscriptionId=AKIAJRJRCKLWZ3QWH7SQ&amp;tag=historyofscie-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=1469635607" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Tropics: The Caribbean Roots of Biodiversity Science <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></em> stands as a thought-provoking, archivally-robust work of immense value to historians working at the intersection of science, professionalization, epistemology, empire, and the environment. Raby focuses on an influential cluster of U.S.-sponsored ecological research stations that took root in the circum-Caribbean neocolonies of Jamaica, Panama, Cuba, and other locales rendered accessible by imperial transportation and patronage networks during the early twentieth century. American Tropics traces the role of U.S. scientists in shaping tropical biology, first as a venue for basic biological research, and later as a much more applied arena for biodiversity studies, tropical conservation, and sustainable global development.</p> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/American-Tropics-Caribbean-Biodiversity-Migrations/dp/1469635607?SubscriptionId=AKIAJRJRCKLWZ3QWH7SQ&amp;tag=historyofscie-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=1469635607" aria-label="American Tropics by Megan Raby"><img alt="American Tropics by Megan Raby" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61vnTsGydxL.jpg" class="book"></a></p> <p>Juxtaposed against this set of shifting paradigms and scientific challenges—including that of extending specific place-based investigations into general knowledge—is the political legacy of colonialism. Even today, tropical biology remains a discipline dominated by outsiders. As Raby persuasively concludes, “Tropical stations must become sites for creating not only knowledge of biodiversity but also new, equitable local and international scientific relations. The future of research in the tropics demands a full recognition of its history.”</p> <p>We applaud Megan Raby’s historical analysis, and are very pleased to recognize <em>American Tropics</em> with the second annual Philip J.

Dr. Aronowsky completed her Ph.D. in the History of Science at Harvard University in 2018. Her beautifully-written paper illuminates an under-explored subject of the shifting thinking about interspecies interactions in space. Through an examination of two cases of unrealized spaceflight technologies — algae-based life support systems and Howard and Eugene Odum’s work of complexity and stability at the Pacific Proving Grounds — Aronowsky shows how NASA’s standards of control limited the possibility of a space cabin that embraced and showcased multispecies interdependency. What if, Aronowsky asks, the space cabin was not understood to be “the ultimate expression of humans’ supremacy over their environment but instead as a space that foregrounds their vital reliance on it”? The implication is, if we consider the cultural and political reach of the Space Race, a vastly different concept of humans’ place in the world. Instead, spaceflight remained emblematic of technoscientific supremacy and strictly minimized human risk. Aronowsky’s remarkably productive analysis of NASA’s road(s) not taken is imaginative and stimulating, and makes this essay a worthy winner of the Rainger Prize.</p> <div class="committee">

The authors take as their premise the seldom-explored fact that recipes are among the earliest and most abiding forms of recording, transmitting, and circulating empirically-based knowledge, particularly in medicine and pharmacology, across numerous languages and traditions. Challenging scholarship on knowledge exchange dominated by accounts of chauvinistic appropriation of non-Western practices or the failures at mutual understanding, the authors’ research in original early sources of a stupendous linguistic range (evident in their translations of texts from Chinese, Latin, French, German, Spanish and Portuguese into English), points to medicinal recipes as artifacts of ongoing, relatively unprejudiced dialogues between Chinese and European scholars. By the early modern period, the written texts of most recipes were similar in layout and content. They typically began with a standard formula specifying ingredients in an itemized column, followed by a prescription offering directions for their processing, dosage, use, and modification for particular situations such as geographical differences or for individual cases (for example, according to the age, gender, or social status of the patient). Recognizing these shared characteristics allowed Hanson and Pomata to identify, through a close comparative analysis, the original 16th-century Chinese source and its likely transcriber-translator, the Jesuit Michael Boym, of the first medicinal recipes intentionally published in Latin in 1682 in order to be disseminated among missionaries and other European travelers in the East.</p> <img alt="Hanson accepts Price/Webster Prize with Lightman" src="/assets/img/hanson.5fea37cc.jpg" class="fullbleed"> <p>But the essay is not merely aimed at authenticating Boym’s work. In their extraordinarily sensitive consideration of irregularities and changes to these texts over time, the authors offer several new, if avowedly provisional, conclusions. First, they show that Boym’s recipes contained transcriptions, translations, and mistranslations from Chinese to Latin, which reflects recipes’ liminal status between oral and written mediums of communication. Second, they speculate that Boym and some of his successors expressed a concern to convey the practice of Chinese medicine as faithfully as possible by relying on the global visual conventions of recipes. Although the Chinese recipes rendered in Latin had titles and listed plants that were exotic to European readers, preserving their vertical format in printed editions signaled a familiar and authoritative type of information. This rich, provocative piece is considerably more than the sum of its parts. It is poised to be agenda setting for specialists but its insights should attract the interest of a broad range of scholars, both within and beyond the history of medicine and science.</p> <div class="committee">

In clear and engaging prose, Robinson narrates the long and checkered history of the Hamitic hypothesis, a theory of human origins and migrations linked to European imperial ambitions in Africa as well as to scientific racism. This theory justified the superiority of whiteness through claims about the dominance and spread of a light-skinned people (the “Caucasian” race), supposedly the first humans, outward from Central Asia. These views were supported by some anthropologists and archaeologists, as well as by explorers like Henry Stanley, who claimed to have seen a tribe of light-skinned Africans in remote mountain regions. Robinson charts the exploits of late-nineteenth-century British explorers and shows how their adventures and misadventures opened the way for the archaeologists and physical anthropologists of the early twentieth century. In doing so, he integrates narratives of exploration and discovery with the human sciences, race theory and colonialism.</p> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lost-White-Tribe-Explorers-Scientists/dp/0199978484?SubscriptionId=AKIAJRJRCKLWZ3QWH7SQ&amp;tag=historyofscie-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=0199978484" aria-label="The Lost White Tribe by Michael F Robinson"><img alt="The Lost White Tribe by Michael F Robinson" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51-DsC%2BIJEL.jpg" class="book"></a></p> <p>Although the story is primarily told from the point of view of Europeans, using mostly British and American sources, it also points to the complex ways that Africans understood and used these highly problematic theories of human origins to frame their understandings of their neighbors as well as of their colonizers. Exploration was inevitably a culturally bound activity, with repercussions well beyond the adventures of the explorers themselves. The Lost White Tribe contributes to the current trend to expose the ideological underpinnings and uses of the exploits of imperial adventurers – whether they are traveling to the North Pole or to the interior of the African continent. In attending particularly to the scientific aspects of these expeditions, Robinson shows convincingly how the development of the human sciences was closely tied to imperial expansion and the articulation of various forms of racist discourse. The Hamitic hypothesis, in various guises, underpinned genocide – in Europe through the Nazi theory of Aryan supremacy and later in Rwanda – and The Lost White Tribe takes the story up to recent struggles over cultural appropriation in the United State, including the controversy over Kennewick man in the Pacific Northwest. Robinson has told this history, rife with resonances for our times, in a fluid and accessible style that speaks to the general reader as well as to the scholarly community.</p> <img alt="Robinson accepts Davis Prize with Lightman" src="/assets/img/robinson.1c23c10b.jpg" class="fullbleed"> <div class="committee">

It deserves major praise, not only for embracing a longue durée view on a science dedicated to long terms. Its author also masterfully wields the tools of the history of science to engage with two concepts, central for both the history and contemporary approaches to environment: Scale and dimension. Scientists had to converge and diverge when studying the small, dynamic and physical of meteorological phenomena, moving from Aristotle’s static model to a concept of a multi-responsive dynamic interplay of forces that fed from the local into the Empire. The communication of climate news was from its inception both pushed forward and plagued by political and economic forces, divided loyalties and the inherent difficulty in defining where weather stopped and climate started. In a gripping language, Coen places local details in appropriate relation to a synthetic overview and convincingly brings to our minds that climate initially was already inextricably linked to politics.</p> <img alt="Coen accepts Davis Prize with Lightman" src="/assets/img/coen.227272c4.jpg" class="fullbleed"> <div class="committee">

Norton Wise, Distinguished Research Professor of History (emeritus) at the University of California, Los Angeles, amply exemplifies these high standards.</p> <p>Wise first trained as an experimental nuclear physicist (Ph.D. from Washington State University, Pullman, WA in 1968) and was working as an assistant professor when — by his own account — he became frustrated with the repetitiveness and seeming superficiality of the questions of his chosen subfield, coupled with severe budget cuts following the collapse of the grand physics boom of the 1950s and 1960s. As it happened, at precisely this moment he found himself reading Thomas S. Kuhn’s <em>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em> (1962, updated 1970), and recognized the predicament that surrounded him within this depiction of science. Stimulated by a fresh perspective on the puzzles of science, he enrolled in 1971 in doctoral study at Princeton University to study the history of physics under Kuhn himself. Both the date and the rationale for his change of specialization are significant, for Wise’s entire career has been dedicated to conceptualizing what it would mean to produce a coherent, post-Kuhnian history of science, as well as a history of science “after physics.”</p> <p>The first two decades of Wise’s scholarship, and the primary source of his tremendous contribution to our field, focuses on the history of physics in the long nineteenth century (dating from, roughly, the work of Lavoisier of the 1780s to the quantum revolution of the 1920s). The cornerstone is, of course, the massive <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Energy-Empire-Paperback-Biographical-Kelvin/dp/0521129214?SubscriptionId=AKIAJRJRCKLWZ3QWH7SQ&amp;tag=historyofscie-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=0521129214" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Energy and Empire: A Biographical Study of Lord Kelvin<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></em> (Cambridge University Press, 1989, co-authored with Crosbie Smith), which won the 1990 Pfizer Prize. Even if this work only functioned as the authoritative biography of William Thomson (1824-1907), it would constitute a scholarly achievement of the highest order. Thomson was instrumental in erecting the foundations of the two central subfields that constituted classical physics: electromagnetism (typically associated with James Clerk Maxwell, Thomson’s contemporary who is much in evidence in this study) and thermodynamics. The technical intricacies of these two devilishly difficult fields are beautifully mapped out in Wise and Smith’s analysis, demonstrating how the various resources which Thomson could draw upon — the otherworldly rigors of the Cambridge Tripos exam, the this-worldly strictures of Scottish latitudinarianism, and the essential esoterica of gutta-percha in the expanding British Empire — were all incorporated into what might at first seem like the arid differential equations of what would later come to be called theoretical physics. It is this conception of “resources” that differentiates Energy and Empire from many other excellent scientific biographies and distinguishes it as an essential contribution to scholarship. The book frames a conception of historical agency where subjects assemble tools from the disparate contexts in which they are embedded. Thomson is not in the grip of a Kuhnian paradigm or under external “influences” that batted him around like a ping-pong ball, but rather an active agent whose life-course enables us to articulate the places of science in a dynamic culture. In Wise’s three companion articles to <em>Energy and Empire</em>, “Work and Waste: Political Economy and Natural Philosophy in Nineteenth Century Britain,” published in <em>History of Science</em> in 1989 and 1990 and filling almost 150 closely-typeset pages, Wise worked out more explicitly this new way of understanding science as not just embedded in culture but as part of culture, drawing its resources from the specificity of a particular time and place. Wise’s emphasis has consistently been on the generation of new ways of knowing out of local circumstances.</p> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Energy-Empire-Paperback-Biographical-Kelvin/dp/0521129214?SubscriptionId=AKIAJRJRCKLWZ3QWH7SQ&amp;tag=historyofscie-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=0521129214" aria-label="Energy and Empire by M.

For decades, he has also explored the peculiarities of nineteenth-century German science and technology, from the holistic statistics that contrasted so starkly with more individualistic French and British counterparts, to the remarkable conjunction of physics, industry, architecture, and aesthetics in Berlin in the middle decades of the nineteenth century. His most recent book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aesthetics-Industry-Science-Helmholtz-Physical/dp/022653135X?SubscriptionId=AKIAJRJRCKLWZ3QWH7SQ&amp;tag=historyofscie-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=022653135X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aesthetics, Industry, and Science: Hermann von Helmholtz and the Berlin Physical Society<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></em> (University of Chicago Press, 2018), is a tour de force three times over: first, for its remarkable scope, covering innovations in mechanics, physiology, and steam technology; second for its imaginative interweaving of sources, from equations to paintings to buildings; and third, for its powerful evocation of the role of aesthetics in the flowering of mid-nineteenth-century German science. This book is a microcosm of its subject matter: a seamless tapestry of the history of science, art, industry, politics, and philosophy; and a beauty to behold, enriched by images that are as much part of the argument as the text.</p> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aesthetics-Industry-Science-Helmholtz-Physical/dp/022653135X?SubscriptionId=AKIAJRJRCKLWZ3QWH7SQ&amp;tag=historyofscie-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=022653135X" aria-label="Aesthetics, Industry, and Science by M.

Almost alone among historians of science of his generation, Wise has continued to wrestle consciously and persistently with foundational questions of the relationship of culture to science that retain the high stakes and refreshing clarity of vision characteristic of the methodological knife-fights over the sociology of scientific knowledge of the 1970s and 1980s. His work, more than that of perhaps anyone else, made the internal/external distinction obsolete. Recall when Wise entered the history of science — 1971 — the year of publication of a bold article by Paul Forman, “Weimar Culture, Causality, and Quantum Theory, 1918-27: Adaptation by German Physicists and Mathematicians to a Hostile Intellectual Environment,” in <em>Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences</em>. Forman’s controversial thesis, arguing that German physicists had capitulated to indeterminacy in the face of public hostility to causality after the loss of the Great War, was one articulation of a post-Kuhnian history of science. Wise found it problematic not only on factual grounds (as did many) but also on conceptual ones, and his “Forman Reformed” (which circulated for years in samizdat before publication) remains the most important riposte to Forman’s thesis. Likewise, countless members of our field have cut their teeth on “Mediating Machines,” “Materialized Epistemology,” or any of a dozen other pieces. Last but certainly not least, consider the analysis of “under the influence” in Wise’s important review of Gross and Levitt’s Higher Superstition, which advances beyond a problematic formulation of “X influenced Y,” a trope Wise saw as centrally implicated in the Science Wars of the 1990s. (A pleasantly frustrating feature of this citation is attempting to craft an adequate tribute to Wise’s work in the field without resorting to “influencetalk.”)</p> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Values-Precision-M-Norton-Wise/dp/0691016011?SubscriptionId=AKIAJRJRCKLWZ3QWH7SQ&amp;tag=historyofscie-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=0691016011" aria-label="Values of Precision by M.

First, Wise has excelled at a form of scholarship that is often not considered as such: editing volumes. Wise’s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Values-Precision-M-Norton-Wise/dp/0691016011?SubscriptionId=AKIAJRJRCKLWZ3QWH7SQ&amp;tag=historyofscie-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=0691016011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Values of Precision <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></em> (Princeton University Press, 1995) is the paragon of the conceptually-unified edited volume, integrated not only at the level of the individual contributions (which are in conversation with each other), but at the level of Wise’s synthetic essay, “Precision: Agent of Unity, Product of Agreement,” divided into four installments throughout the book. This work remains a staple, defining how we collectively discuss the important topics of precision and standardization. It was but the first in a series, followed by his <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Explanations-Historical-Perspectives-Cultural-ebook/dp/B00EHNSFGC?SubscriptionId=AKIAJRJRCKLWZ3QWH7SQ&amp;tag=historyofscie-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B00EHNSFGC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Growing Explanations: Historical Perspectives on Recent Science<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></em> (Duke University Press, 2004) and (with Angela N.

Wise has pushed his colleagues to reevaluate the importance of narrative as indispensable not just for us historians, but for the scientists that we study. These projects demonstrate his continuing interest in how other fields are not like physics, how the conceptual categories set out in Kuhn’s day centered on the physical sciences are no longer adequate for our much richer field.</p> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Explanations-Historical-Perspectives-Cultural-ebook/dp/B00EHNSFGC?SubscriptionId=AKIAJRJRCKLWZ3QWH7SQ&amp;tag=historyofscie-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B00EHNSFGC" aria-label="Growing Explanations by M. Norton Wise"><img alt="Growing Explanations by M. Norton Wise" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41wSGTPMunL.jpg" class="book"></a></p> <p>The second is Wise’s energetic promotion of “genetics and society” at UCLA and in the field at large. He was founding co-director of the Institute for Society and Genetics, a brave initiative to bring together the modern biomedical sciences, history of science, legal scholarship, and ethics. Although biology was never his field, he went at the intellectual program of non-reductionist genetics with characteristic enthusiasm, and worked to assemble an interdisciplinary faculty that could bring history, social science, and biology into constructive engagement.</p> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Science-without-Laws-Exemplary-Narratives/dp/0822340682?SubscriptionId=AKIAJRJRCKLWZ3QWH7SQ&amp;tag=historyofscie-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=0822340682" aria-label="Science without Laws by M. Norton Wise"><img alt="Science without Laws by M. Norton Wise" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/4190juH99OL.jpg" class="book"></a></p> <p>Finally, it bears emphasis that our most respected scholars are not defined just by the words they put on the page, but by the communities they foster within the discipline. Wise nourished flourishing programs in the history of science not once but three times, first at UCLA, next at Princeton University, and then again at UCLA. Dozens of Wise’s students walk the halls of our conferences, teach the history of science to new generations, and continue to enrich the field with their own research. Each of them carries what might be called a “Nortonian” stamp in their way of thinking, one that pushes for the highest intellectual and methodological standards. As one of those students put it in a fitting recent tweet (where else?), in reference to Wise’s pedagogy: “His resource is very very strong.” Some lessons stay learned.</p> <img alt="Wise accepts Sarton Medal with Lightman" src="/assets/img/wise.6e27fb62.jpg" class="fullbleed"> <div class="committee">
