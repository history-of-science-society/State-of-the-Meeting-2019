## Praise for the Utrecht LAC and volunteers

The following represent a handful of praise offered to the Utrecht Local Arrangements Committee and volunteers, without whom the meeting would not have been a success.

Thank you!

<pullQuote title="Very pleasant venue, good signage, friendly and knowledgeable student
assistants." />
<pullQuote title="I mostly want to praise them for the incredibly fantastic job. They
immediately understood that the one thing that was urgently needed (on
top of everything else) was cold water everywhere, and a lot of it. This
worked excellently well. I also was impressed by their ability to reschedule
sessions spontaneously into rooms with AC. Top job!! Thank you very, very
much!!" />

<pullQuote title="They really did a wonderful job!" />
<pullQuote title="They were fantastic!! They worked with unusual conditions and rose to the
challenge-impressive!" />
<pullQuote title="The local organizers did a fantastic job, especially in light of the changes
that needed to be made as a result of the unusual temperatures. I think this
was the best-ever HSS meeting I've attended." />
<pullQuote title="I think they did a heroic job in unprecedented climatic conditions. I really
appreciated the water (including the 'real' fruity water), the reusable drink
flask, the efficiency of registration etc., the resources of the institution as a
whole. I know this is not a suggestion, but I would like to express it anyway,
since it was one of the best HSS meetings I have attended!" />
<pullQuote title="The student assistants were uniformly awesome -- super helpful and
friendly and doing a great job. Thanks!" />
<pullQuote title="A big thank you for the extremely smooth organisation!
The 'Crew' was always easily recognisable with their yellow shirts, they
were everywhere (which was amazing), and also did a really good job in
pointing people into the right direction for the lectures. A suburb
organisation, thanks!" />
